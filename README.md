# sublime-text-plugins

The plugin under the "Custom" folder was written originally because I wanted to enable right click->open folder on the tab, as Visual Studio allows. Shortly after writing that, I realized an existing command existed in Sublime Text by RMB'ing anywhere in the textual contents of your doc. At that point, I wrote another "plugin" that just maps that command to show on the context menu on the tab where I'm used to seeing it. It was a good learning experience!

To enable either of these, just drop the containing top level folder of whichever plugin you want to add into the packages folder (found by Preferences->Browse Packages...).
